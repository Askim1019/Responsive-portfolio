# Responsive-portfolio


# This project involves practicing with css-media queries of 980px, 768px, and 640px to make a responsive portfolio webpage without using bootstrap.

# This project was used with visual studio code editor, but any editor should work. 

# The stylesheets linked must be linked relative to the path in the users filesystem. 

# For manual testing, resize the windows to the 3 different media pixels to test out responsiveness of the website.
